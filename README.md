# nimblerx_app_submission

A code assessment submission to NimblexRx.

# Some things that could be improved with more time:
1. Add all tests.
2. Display of Store hours could be cleaned up to look more consistent
3. Caching of data
4. Check for internet connectivity before making API calls
5. We don't really ask for the user's location in this example but you'd have to check permissions and such if you did.
6. Phone number display format needs improvement.
7. Clean up the provider file to break up the different screens into their own providers as they get more complex.  '
